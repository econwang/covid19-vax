This repository contains Stata code used for replication. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 17.0.

Replication for the paper relies on the fifth wave of CHARLS data, to be released within two years after fieldwork is finished. The public release data will be available for download from its official website: <https://charls.pku.edu.cn/en/>.

The code do-file is structured with four sections.

1. Creation of vaccination data in 2022
2. Data appending with weights, demographics, health-related measures, and vaccination in 2021
3. Descriptive analysis (Table 1, Figure 2, and ODI Figure 1)
4. Regression (Tables 2,3; ODI Tables 2,3,4,5)
